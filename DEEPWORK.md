## My deep work rules:
1. 3 or 4 hours planned and without any distraction, no phone, no internet (if possible), no music. 

2. No multitasking, no switching between tasks.

3. Producitvity law: 

    **excellent work = time spend on it * intensity of concentration**

4. connectivity is the enemy of concentration

5. prove / track your deep work

6. having rituals and routines is truly important you need less discipline to do the work


## Some quotes:

"I ruthlessly eliminate all that is superficial and meticulously cultivate the intensity of my depth of concentration."

"less distraction = less mental noise"

 "Gallager: who you are is the sum of what you think about, feel, and do. If you want to change who you are, you must change what you think about, feel, and do. If you want to change what you think about, feel, and do, you must change what you pay attention to."

David Brooks: "Greatest minds think like artists but work like accountants" (meaning plaanning and discipline)


## Deep work Ritual
*the why*: 

    The idea behind the ritual is to minimize the mental energy you need to think about you do you need / what do you want to do.
<br>
Crafting is own ritual needs some iterations, but when you find it, it's highly beneficial
<br>

**questions to answer to define your ritual**: 
1. *where do you work and for how long*
     - for example: work at my desk, door closed, desk tidy for 3 hours 
2. *define rules to follow during deep work*
     - for example: no phone, no internet, no music, no multitasking, no switching between tasks, this task made in 30mn...
3. *what help do you provide yourself during deep work?*
    - can be a little walk, some fitness exercices, some coffee, some fruits...

<br>

### Collaborative work
good to:
- find ideas
- brainstorm
- innovate
- push yourself to deep dive into a thought, a subject.

# 4DX strategy:
- **Discipline 1: Focus On The Wildly Important**

    "the more you try to do, the less you succeed"
    need to have a limited number of goals
    Si vous souhaitez remporter la bataille de l'attention, n'essayez pas de dire non aux distractions, mais dites oui aux sujets qui font naitre une envie irrépressible et laissez celle ci supplanter tout le reste

- **Discipline 2: Act-On The Lead Measures**
    Need to evaluate your success 

    Se fixer des indicateurs strategiques et non de réussites 
    Par exemple: 
    indicateur de reussite: 
        50K de CA / an
        Stage chez Google
        1000 paying users
    indicateur strategiques: 
        number of hours spent on deep work
        number of CV sent 
        number of potential customers contacted

- **Discipline 3: Keep A Compelling Scoreboard**
    1. you see your progress
    2. you see others progress

    -> NEED TO COUNT & DISPLAY IT VISUALLY
        can be a scoreboard on your desk
        can be share whithin your team (everyone see others results)
        can be share with your friends

- **Discipline 4: Create A Cadence Of Accountability**
    weekly reflect (with others if possible)
    what could you improve for the next week?
        - take precise actions

to refuel, to have more ideas, to let your subconcious mind to the work
SHUTDOWN ROUTINE: 
    algoritm to execute at the end of the day
    begin
        for each tasks not done:
            plan it or drop it
        Tell "shutdown done" to your brain
    end

    need to stop each days at one point, until the next day
        -> no more email red, no thought about work, no more work
        -> better if it's a ritual
            for example: each day after 6pm/after dinner...

plan the distractions
plan when you can use internet, outside this time, you just have to wait, be intransigent
look for waiting and ennui (new experience)

for example: 
    everyday before 2pm & after 9pm, no internet
        every morning = no internet
        every evening = no internet

proactive meditation (for example: during a walk)


do not entertain yourself with internet
plan your distraction
we naturaly spent most of our time on autopilot

<br>

## plan every minutes of your day

*the why*: 

    the problem is to be in autopilot and not being aware of what you do, so spend your time on things that are not important or distracting yourself with things you don't want

<br>

*the goal*:

- to be aware of what you do and why you do it
- to decide upfront what you want to do

<br>

*the method*

1. plan every minutes of your day upfront (the day before)

2. adapt your plan when something unexpected happens 
<br>
    example:
    - a task takes more time than expected
    - an unplaned opportunity comes 
    - you need to do something you didn't plan
    - you don't have time to do everything 

*note*:

you can adapt it several times a day, that's not a problem
